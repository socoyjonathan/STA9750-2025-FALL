In <a href="https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini01.html" data-original-href="https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini01.html">Mini-Project #01</a>, students will explore the Netflix Top 10 data to identify the most popular programming on the platform. Despite the relative simplicity of this data set, it is too big for traditional spreadsheet software (i.e., Microsoft Excel) to handle. Students deliver their results in the form of a press release, conveying the results of complex analytical pipelines in a pithy interpretable format.
