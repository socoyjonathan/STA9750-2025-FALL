Hola! My name is Jonathan Socoy, 
I have a B.S. in Applied Math from Columbia University and 
I am currently searching for industry opportunities in Quantitative Analytics. 
While I am applying for job opportunities, I am currently deepening my expertise 
through an MS in Quantitative Methods and Modeling at Baruch College.
